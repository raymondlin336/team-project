# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Team members are expected to reply on discord within 24 hours.

* Team members should notify the team if they are going to miss a lecture, tutorial, or team meeting.

* Team members are expected to write detailed comments in their code, and sufficiently detailed commit messages.

---

### Cooperation & Teamwork

* Team members are expected to ask for help when stuck, but only after making a reasonable effort to solve the problem themselves.

* We need to be able to see effort in resolving issues and making contributions on their own. Expect help after that.

* Support teammates, it is a group project so we will only do great if we work together.

---

## Decision Making

* We will try to reach decisions via a unanimous vote of all memebers that are present at the time of the meeting. If members did not state their absense ahead of time, their vote would not be counted.

---

## Conflict resolution

* Team members will try to resolve the conflict through discussion. If this fails, team members will involve a course administrator as a mediator.

---

## Accountability

* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.

* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.

---

By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, discussed, and agreed to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
