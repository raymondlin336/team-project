# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.


## Project Summary

### Mini Wordle:
#### General idea: 3 main panels of UI
- Log in and log out page

- Personal progress page
#### API usage:
- Word pool
- Account info storage
- Just a simple wordle game with a 4x4 or 5x5 matrix of buttons, can be broken down into the UI, the backend, and other segments for a more spread-out workload.
- Optional steps: more visually appealing workload, adding and approving friends, making your results sharable
