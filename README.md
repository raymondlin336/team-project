# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.
